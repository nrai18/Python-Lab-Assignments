# Question 1: Create a program to calculate volume of the sphere when radius is given in double from the console.

# input - take radius of sphere from user
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the sphere: "))

# computation - apply volume formula (4/3) * pi * r^3
volume = (4 / 3) * 3.14159 * radius ** 3

# output - print the volume of the sphere
print("Volume of the sphere is:", volume)
